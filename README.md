- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Arturo, I'm studying computer engineering at Universidad Nacional AutÃ³noma de MÃ©xico. I've always been a procrastinator 
and haven't use my time at it's full potential. I've started this account to review all the subjects I've seen in college, expanding
it with fun projects and sharing it with the world. I am excited for this new journey for new and longlasting knowledge.

- Videogames and robotics are my passion and the reason why I'm in tech.  
- Iâ€™m currently learning openCV in python 3. I want to reinforce my knowledge in java and to learn c++.
- I'll use this account to work on personal or school projects and to upload the notes I write in other subjects (like math).
- My twitter @AcostaUnkindled, I rarely tweet, but that may change when I create more things to share.
